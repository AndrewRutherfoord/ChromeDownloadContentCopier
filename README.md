## Installing the extension

2. In any chromium based browser, navigate to the 'Manage Extensions' page
3. Find the 'load unpacked' button (You may need to enable developer mode for this to appear)

This should install the extension.

## Usage

The extension will only work on a page if it has been activated for that page. To activate it, click on the extension icon in the extensions dropdown to show the popup. Here you can activate the extension for the current page. You can also choose which file types you would like the extension to block and copy the content. On submission of this form, it will be saved for this host. Now any downloads of the selected types will be blocked and the contents shown in the popup.

To copy the content, open the extension popup and it will be shown in the text area. Here you can edit the text if you would like, and then copy the content by clicking the copy button.
